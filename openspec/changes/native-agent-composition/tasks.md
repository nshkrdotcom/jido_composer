## Phase 1: AgentNode.run/3 Fix

> **References**: `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Phase 1. `native-agent-composition.md` §2. `docs/design/nodes/README.md` (AgentNode). `prototypes/test_agent_node_run.exs` (7 tests). `prototypes/learnings.md` §Round 3 findings 1-3.

- [x] 1.1 Write unit tests in `test/jido/composer/node/agent_node_test.exs` — update existing test expecting `{:error, :not_directly_runnable}` to test sync delegation: `run/3` delegates to `run_sync/2` for workflow agents, `run/3` delegates to `query_sync/3` for orchestrator agents, `run/3` returns `{:error, {:not_directly_runnable, :async}}` for async/streaming, `run/3` returns error for agents without sync entry point
- [x] 1.2 Write DSL unit tests — `test/jido/composer/workflow/dsl_test.exs`: `run_sync` handles `SpawnAgent` directives for workflow agents. `test/jido/composer/orchestrator/dsl_test.exs`: `query_sync` handles `SpawnAgent` directives for nested agents (LLMStub plug mode)
- [x] 1.3 Write integration tests — `test/integration/workflow_agent_node_test.exs`: workflow with nested workflow agent completes, workflow with nested orchestrator agent completes (LLMStub). `test/integration/composition_test.exs`: AgentNode in FanOut branch executes successfully
- [x] 1.4 Write e2e test with LLMStub — `test/e2e/e2e_test.exs`: workflow with nested orchestrator via AgentNode.run/3 (LLMStub plug mode)
- [x] 1.5 Add test support agents in `test/support/test_agents.exs` — `TestWorkflowAgent` (2-state: action → done), `TestOrchestratorAgent` (single-tool, for nesting tests)
- [x] 1.6 Implement `AgentNode.run/3` in `lib/jido/composer/node/agent_node.ex` — sync mode delegates to `run_sync/2` or `query_sync/3` via cond chain (`native-agent-composition.md` §2.1)
- [x] 1.7 Add SpawnAgent handler in `lib/jido/composer/workflow/dsl.ex` `run_directives/3` — same pattern as RunInstruction but calls `run_sync` (`native-agent-composition.md` §2.3)
- [x] 1.8 Add SpawnAgent handler in `lib/jido/composer/orchestrator/dsl.ex` `run_orch_directives/3` — same pattern for orchestrator sync loop
- [x] 1.9 Record e2e cassette `e2e_workflow_nested_orchestrator` — delete stub, run `RECORD_CASSETTES=true mix test`, verify replay
- [x] 1.10 PHASE GATE: `mix precommit` — all tests pass, formatting clean, credo clean, docs build

- [x] 2.2 Write Machine unit tests in `test/jido/composer/workflow/machine_test.exs` — `apply_result` resolves `NodeIO.text` to map, resolves `NodeIO.object` to map, passes through bare maps unchanged
- [x] 2.3 Write Orchestrator strategy tests in `test/jido/composer/orchestrator/strategy_test.exs` — final answer wraps as `NodeIO.text` (LLMStub direct mode)
- [x] 2.4 Write AgentTool tests in `test/jido/composer/orchestrator/agent_tool_test.exs` — `to_tool_result` unwraps `NodeIO.text` for LLM, unwraps `NodeIO.map` for LLM
- [x] 2.5 Write FanOutNode tests in `test/jido/composer/node/fan_out_node_test.exs` — `merge_results` handles mixed `NodeIO` and bare map branches
- [x] 2.6 Write e2e test — `test/e2e/e2e_test.exs`: nested orchestrator returns text, adapted to map in parent workflow (LLMStub plug mode)
- [x] 2.7 Implement `Jido.Composer.NodeIO` in `lib/jido/composer/node_io.ex` (NEW) — struct with `type`, `value`, `schema`, `meta`; constructors `map/1`, `text/1`, `object/2`; `to_map/1`, `unwrap/1`, `mergeable?/1`; `@derive Jason.Encoder`
- [x] 2.8 Add `resolve_result/1` in `lib/jido/composer/workflow/machine.ex` `apply_result/2` — unwrap `NodeIO` via `to_map/1`, pass through bare maps
- [x] 2.9 Wrap final answers in `lib/jido/composer/orchestrator/strategy.ex` — `{:final_answer, text}` → `NodeIO.text(text)` in `handle_llm_response`
- [x] 2.10 Unwrap NodeIO in `lib/jido/composer/orchestrator/agent_tool.ex` `to_tool_result/3` — text stays string, map stays map
- [x] 2.11 Add NodeIO-aware merge in `lib/jido/composer/node/fan_out_node.ex` `merge_results/2`
- [x] 2.12 Add optional `input_type/1` and `output_type/1` callbacks in `lib/jido/composer/node.ex`
- [x] 2.13 Record e2e cassette `e2e_nodeio_text_adaptation` — delete stub, record, verify replay
- [x] 2.14 PHASE GATE: `mix precommit`

- [ ] 6.3 Write unit tests in `test/jido/composer/resume_test.exs` (NEW) — `resume/5` delivers signal to live agent, thaws from checkpoint when not live, rejects already-resumed checkpoint (idempotency), returns error for unknown agent
- [ ] 6.4 Write integration tests in `test/integration/hitl_persistence_test.exs` — cascading checkpoint (child before parent), top-down resume (parent thaws, respawns children), fan-out partial completion survives checkpoint, schema migration v1 → v2

- [ ] 6.8 Implement `Jido.Composer.Resume` in `lib/jido/composer/resume.ex` (NEW) — `resume/5` API: find live agent or thaw from checkpoint, deliver resume signal, handle idempotency
- [ ] 6.9 Add checkpoint hooks to `lib/jido/composer/workflow/strategy.ex` — `prepare_for_checkpoint`, `reattach_runtime_config`, ChildRef lifecycle tracking for nested children
- [ ] 6.10 Add checkpoint hooks to `lib/jido/composer/orchestrator/strategy.ex` — closure stripping, conversation offload (optional for large conversations), same ChildRef tracking
