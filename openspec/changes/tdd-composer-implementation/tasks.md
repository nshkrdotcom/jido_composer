## 1. Project Scaffold & Test Support

> **References**: `PLAN.md` Step 1 (project scaffold). `docs/design/testing.md` — test directory structure, cassette helper patterns, sensitive data filters. `prototypes/learnings.md` — all sections provide patterns for test helpers.

- [x] 1.1 Create `lib/jido/composer/` directory structure matching PLAN.md file layout
- [x] 1.2 Create `Jido.Composer` top-level module with moduledoc (replace placeholder)
- [x] 1.3 Create `test/support/test_actions.ex` with stub action modules (AddAction, MultiplyAction, FailAction, SlowAction, etc.)
- [x] 1.4 Create `test/support/test_agents.ex` with stub agent modules for composition tests
- [x] 1.5 Create `test/support/cassette_helper.ex` with centralized sensitive data filters and cassette setup helpers
- [x] 1.6 Update `test/test_helper.exs` to configure ExUnit and load support modules

## 2. Error Module

> **References**: `docs/design/glossary.md` — error terminology. `PLAN.md` — error.ex in file structure. Uses Splode for structured errors (see `mix.exs` dependency `{:splode, "~> 0.3.0"}`). Moved early because Node, Machine, Strategy, and all subsequent modules need Composer-specific error types.
