# Category Theory Foundations

The composability of Jido Composer is grounded in category theory. These
structures are not exposed to users directly — the user-facing model is FSM
states and transitions — but they provide the algebraic guarantees that make
composition safe and predictable.

## The Category: Ctx

We define a category **Ctx** where:

- **Objects**: There is a single object, Context (the type of all context maps).
  Since there is one object, this is technically a monoid viewed as a
  single-object category.
- **Morphisms**: [Nodes](nodes/README.md). Each node is a morphism
  `Context -> Context`. An ActionNode wrapping ExtractAction is a morphism. An
  AgentNode wrapping ResearchAgent is a morphism.
- **Composition (`>>>`)**: Sequential chaining. Given nodes
  `f: Context -> Context` and `g: Context -> Context`, their composition
  `f >>> g` means "run f, deep-merge its output into the context, then run g on
  the result."
- **Identity (`id`)**: The pass-through node that returns its input unchanged.

## Why Scoped Deep Merge is the Right Monoidal Operation

The [context](nodes/context-flow.md) map accumulates results as it flows through
nodes. Each node's output is **scoped** under a key derived from its name (the
workflow state name or orchestrator tool name). This scoping ensures that
cross-node key collisions cannot occur, which eliminates the primary risk of
deep merge: silent data loss for non-map values like lists.

Within scoped accumulation, the combining operation reduces to `Map.put` on
disjoint keys followed by `deep_merge` for the overall context structure:

| Property             | Guarantee                                                                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Associativity**    | `merge(merge(a, b), c) = merge(a, merge(b, c))` — guaranteed by map merge semantics |
| **Identity element** | The empty map `%{}` — `merge(%{}, a) = a = merge(a, %{})`                           |
| **Closure**          | Merging two maps produces a map                                                     |
| **Disjointness**     | Scoped keys never collide across nodes — merge is lossless                          |

This makes `(Map, deep_merge, %{})` a monoid, and by extension the nodes form
an **endomorphism monoid** over context maps. The scoping convention strengthens
this from a theoretical guarantee to a practical one.

## Kleisli Category: Error-Aware Composition

Raw composition ignores failures. In practice, nodes can fail. We lift into the
**Kleisli category** over the Result monad:

- **Morphisms**: `Context -> {:ok, Context} | {:error, Reason}`
- **Kleisli composition (`>=>` / bind)**: If `f` succeeds, pass its result to
  `g`. If `f` fails, short-circuit immediately.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    F["f(ctx)"]
    OK["{:ok, ctx'}"]
    ERR["{:error, reason}"]
    G["g(ctx')"]
    RESULT["result"]

    F --> OK --> G --> RESULT
    F --> ERR --> RESULT
```

This gives fail-fast semantics for free: if any node in a pipeline fails, the
entire pipeline short-circuits. The [Workflow](workflow/README.md) strategy's
error transitions (`{:_, :error} => :failed`) are the FSM representation of this
Kleisli short-circuit.

The Kleisli category preserves the monoid laws:

| Law                | Statement                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Associativity**  | `(f >=> g) >=> h = f >=> (g >=> h)` — guaranteed by Result monad associativity |
| **Left identity**  | `return >=> f = f` where `return = fn ctx -> {:ok, ctx} end`                   |
| **Right identity** | `f >=> return = f`                                                             |

## Enriched Composition: Outcomes as Coproducts

Standard Kleisli gives two paths: success or failure. But workflows need
branching — a validation node might succeed with `:ok` or `:invalid`. We extend
the result type:

```
Node: Context -> {:ok, Context, Outcome}
```

where [Outcome](glossary.md#outcome) is an atom (`:ok`, `:error`, `:invalid`,
`:retry`, etc.). This is a **tagged coproduct** (sum type) that the FSM
transition table dispatches on. The outcome does not alter the algebraic
properties — it is metadata that the FSM uses to select the next morphism.

In categorical terms, each outcome defines a different "output port" of the
morphism, and the FSM [transition table](workflow/state-machine.md#transition-lookup)
is a **routing function** that maps `(State, Outcome) -> NextState`. This is
analogous to a **copairing** in a category with coproducts.

## Arrow Combinators: Parallel and Fan-Out

Beyond sequential composition, we support:

### Fan-out (product / `&&&`)

```
fanout(f, g)(ctx) = merge(f(ctx), g(ctx))
```

Run two nodes on the same input in parallel. Both receive the full context;
their results are merged. In the [Workflow](workflow/README.md),
[FanOutNode](nodes/README.md#fanoutnode) provides this as a first-class Node
type — it encapsulates concurrent execution behind the standard Node interface.
In the [Orchestrator](orchestrator/README.md), the LLM can invoke multiple
tools simultaneously.

### Split (first / `***`)

```
split(f, g)({a, b}) = {f(a), g(b)}
```

Route different subsets of context to different nodes. This maps directly to
the [scoped accumulation model](nodes/context-flow.md#output-scoping): each
node's output is stored under its own key (`:extract`, `:transform`, etc.),
providing natural key-level isolation.

### Choice (case / `|||`)

```
choice(f, g)(Left(a)) = f(a)
choice(f, g)(Right(b)) = g(b)
```

This is exactly the **conditional transition** in the FSM: based on outcome,
route to one node or another.

These combinators are not separate abstractions — they are all expressible
through the FSM transition table and the [Node](nodes/README.md) interface. The
FSM is the concrete syntax; the arrow combinators are the denotational semantics.

## The Orchestrator as Free Category

The [Workflow](workflow/README.md) is a **specific composition** — a concrete
morphism chain defined at compile time via the FSM.

The [Orchestrator](orchestrator/README.md) is the **free category** generated
by the available nodes. Given a set of nodes `{f, g, h}`, the free category
contains all possible compositions: `f`, `g`, `h`, `f >>> g`, `g >>> f`,
`f >>> g >>> h`, etc. The LLM acts as the composition strategy — at runtime, it
selects which morphisms to compose and in what order.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Free Category (all possible compositions)"
        F["f"]
        G["g"]
        H["h"]
        FG["f >>> g"]
        GF["g >>> f"]
        FGH["f >>> g >>> h"]
        GH["g >>> h"]
        FH["f >>> h"]
        MORE["..."]
    end

    LLM["LLM selects path"] -->|"runtime choice"| FGH
    FSM["FSM fixes path"] -->|"compile-time choice"| FG

    style LLM fill:#f5f5ff,stroke:#666
    style FSM fill:#fff5f5,stroke:#666
```

This is why the Orchestrator is strictly more powerful but less predictable than
the Workflow. The Workflow is a single chosen path through the free category;
the Orchestrator explores the space dynamically.

## Coalgebraic Streaming

For the streaming communication mode (agent node that emits intermediate
results):

A streaming agent is a **coalgebra**: `Context -> (Context, Event) Stream`. It
unfolds a sequence of state transitions, emitting an event at each step. The
parent observes this stream and can react to intermediate values.

In categorical terms, this is an **F-coalgebra** where
`F(X) = Context x Event x (X + 1)` (the `+ 1` represents termination). The
agent's FSM drives the unfolding, and specific states are designated as
"observation points" that emit events upstream.

## Nesting as Functorial Embedding

When an agent running its own [Workflow](workflow/README.md) appears as a single
[Node](nodes/README.md) to a parent composition, this is a **functorial
embedding**. The entire inner category (with its own morphisms, composition, and
identity) is mapped to a single morphism in the outer category. The functor
preserves composition and identity — the inner workflow's sequential pipeline
appears as an atomic operation to the parent.

## Laws That Must Hold

tests:

| **Associativity**        | `(f >>> g) >>> h = f >>> (g >>> h)`             | Grouping does not matter for sequential composition                     |
| **Left zero**            | `error >>> f = error`                           | An error node followed by anything still produces the error             |
| **Merge associativity**  | `merge(merge(a, b), c) = merge(a, merge(b, c))` | Context accumulation is associative                                     |
