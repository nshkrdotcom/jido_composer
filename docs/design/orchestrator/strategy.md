# Orchestrator Strategy

The Orchestrator Strategy implements the `Jido.Agent.Strategy` behaviour to
drive the [ReAct loop](README.md). It manages conversation state, LLM
invocations, tool execution, and result accumulation.

## Strategy State

The strategy stores its state under `agent.state.__strategy__`:

| Field                   | Type                        | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## LLM Execution via Directives

The strategy never calls ReqLLM directly. Instead, it builds a
`Jido.Instruction` targeting `LLMAction` and emits a RunInstruction directive.
The instruction params contain all LLM-related state as flat keys:
`conversation`, `tool_results`, `tools`, `model`, `query`, `system_prompt`,
`temperature`, `max_tokens`, `stream`, `llm_opts`, and `req_options`.

LLMAction calls the appropriate ReqLLM function based on `stream` and
returns `{response, updated_conversation}` as an instruction result. The result
is routed back to `cmd/3` as `:orchestrator_llm_result`. This keeps the strategy
pure and testable. The strategy stores the updated `ReqLLM.Context` in its state
for the next LLM call. It never inspects the conversation's internal structure
-- req_llm owns the message format. See
[LLM Integration — Conversation State](llm-integration.md#conversation-state).

The `req_options` from strategy state are included in the instruction params.
LLMAction maps them to req_llm's `req_http_options` key, enabling
[cassette-based testing](../testing.md) by injecting a plug that intercepts
HTTP calls. The strategy treats `req_options` as opaque -- it passes them
through without inspection. See
[LLM Integration — Req Options](llm-integration.md#req-options).

## Tool Execution

When the LLM returns tool calls:

- **ActionNode tools** — The strategy creates an Instruction from the node's
  action module with the tool call arguments as params, then emits a
  RunInstruction directive. The result flows back as `:orchestrator_tool_result`.

- **AgentNode tools** — The strategy emits a SpawnAgent directive. The child
  agent lifecycle follows the same pattern as in
  [Workflow AgentNode execution](../workflow/strategy.md#execution-flow-agentnode).
  Results flow back as `:orchestrator_child_result`.

In both cases, results are collected as normalized `tool_result` structs
(`%{id, name, result}`) and passed to the next LLMAction call via
`emit_llm_call/1`. LLMAction converts them to provider-specific message
formats internally via `ReqLLM.Context.tool_result/3`.

## Iteration Safety

The strategy tracks iterations and halts with an error if `max_iterations` is
reached without a final answer. This prevents runaway loops where the LLM
repeatedly calls tools without converging.

## Context Accumulation

Unlike the Workflow where context flows linearly through the machine, the
Orchestrator accumulates context across all tool executions within the ReAct
loop. Each tool result is **scoped under the tool name** (derived from the
node's name) and deep-merged into the strategy's `context` field. This
prevents data loss when multiple tools produce similarly-shaped results.

When the LLM calls the same tool multiple times, the second call's result
overwrites the first under the same scope key. The tool implementation can
read its previous output from `context[tool_name]` and append if needed.

### Context Layers

The Orchestrator uses the same [context layering](../nodes/context-flow.md#context-layers)
model as the Workflow. The `context` field holds a `Context.t()` struct with
three layers:

- **Ambient** — read-only data (e.g., `org_id`, `trace_id`) extracted from
  start params using the `ambient_keys` list declared in the DSL. Ambient is
  also inherited from a parent composition when the orchestrator runs as a
  child agent (via the `__ambient__` key in the flattened context).
- **Working** — mutable tool results accumulated under scoped keys via
  `Context.apply_result/3`.
- **Fork functions** — MFA tuples applied at SpawnAgent boundaries when the
  orchestrator spawns AgentNode tools as children.

#### Initialization

During `init/2`, the strategy reads `ambient:` and `fork_fns:` from the DSL
options and builds a `Context.new(fork_fns: fork_fns)`. During
`:orchestrator_start`, ambient keys are split from the start params and placed
in the ambient layer. If the start params contain an `__ambient__` key (because
this orchestrator is a child of another composition), those inherited ambient
values are merged in as well.

#### Tool Directive Construction

When building directives for tool calls, the strategy uses the context layers:

- **ActionNode tools** — The strategy merges tool call arguments into the
  working layer, then passes `Context.to_flat_map/1` as the instruction params.
  The action receives the full accumulated context including `__ambient__`.
- **AgentNode tools** — The strategy calls `Context.fork_for_child/1` to run
  fork functions (e.g., OTel span creation), then serializes the forked
  context into the SpawnAgent directive's opts.

#### LLM Visibility

The LLM does not see raw ambient context in conversation messages — it sees the
system prompt (which may incorporate ambient data) and tool results (which come
from the working layer).

## Tool Concurrency

The Orchestrator can dispatch multiple tool calls in parallel when the LLM
returns several in a single turn. Tool concurrency state is encapsulated in
a `ToolConcurrency` struct (`pending`, `completed`, `queued`, `max_concurrency`)
managed via `Jido.Composer.ToolConcurrency`. A configurable `max_concurrency`
limit controls how many tool calls execute simultaneously. When more tool calls
are returned than the limit allows, excess calls are queued and dispatched as
earlier ones complete.

Status computation across tool concurrency, approval gate, and suspended calls
is handled by `Jido.Composer.Orchestrator.StatusComputer.compute/3`.

## Tool Suspension

A tool may suspend for non-HITL reasons (rate limits, async external jobs,
resource throttling). The strategy detects suspension through two paths:

| Detection Path | Condition                                                     | Source                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Direct status  | `params[:status] == :suspend`                                 | Strategy-level tests        |
| Effects-based  | `params[:status] == :ok` and `:suspend` in `params[:effects]` | Runtime DirectiveExec paths |

Both paths route to `handle_tool_suspension`, which:

1. Extracts or builds a `Suspension` struct from the tool result
2. Removes the call from `tool_concurrency.pending`
3. Stores `%{suspension: suspension, call: call}` in `suspended_calls` keyed
   by `suspension.id`
4. Emits a Suspend directive
5. Calls `Checkpoint.maybe_add_checkpoint_and_stop/2` to append a
   CheckpointAndStop directive when `hibernate_after` is configured

When other tool calls are still in flight, the strategy remains in
`:awaiting_tools_and_suspension`. When all running tools finish and only
suspended calls remain, status transitions to `:awaiting_suspension`.

### Tool Suspend Resume

When `cmd(:suspend_resume, %{suspension_id: id})` arrives:

| Condition                 | Behaviour                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `data` provided in resume | Data is used directly as the tool result (no re-execution)    |
| No `data` in resume       | Tool call is re-dispatched via a new RunInstruction directive |
| Unknown `suspension_id`   | Error directive emitted                                       |

In both success paths, the `suspended_calls` entry for the given ID is cleared.
The strategy then calls `check_all_tools_done` to determine if all tool calls
(pending, gated, and suspended) have resolved. If so, it transitions to
`:awaiting_llm` and emits the next LLM call with all collected tool results.

### Tool Suspend Timeout

When `cmd(:suspend_timeout, %{suspension_id: id})` arrives and the suspension
is still active, the strategy converts it to an error tool result, clears the
entry from `suspended_calls`, and checks tool completion. If the suspension was
already resumed, the timeout is a no-op.

## Termination Tool

The termination tool provides structured output from the ReAct loop. Instead of
a separate generation mode, structured output is modeled as a tool the LLM
calls when it has the final answer.

### Configuration

The DSL accepts a `termination_tool:` option — a `Jido.Action` module whose
`name()`, `description()`, and `schema()` define the tool the LLM sees. The
action's `run/2` validates and transforms the arguments into the structured
result.

During `init/2`, the strategy:

1. Builds a `ReqLLM.Tool` from the action module via `AgentTool.to_tool/1`
2. Appends it to the `tools` list (so the LLM sees it alongside regular tools)
3. Registers the tool name in `name_atoms`
4. Stores `termination_tool_name` and `termination_tool_mod` in state

The termination tool is **not** added to the `nodes` map — it is not a regular
node and does not participate in context scoping or approval gating.

### Interception

When the LLM returns tool calls, `dispatch_tool_calls/3` checks for a
termination call **after** the max-iterations guard but **before** the
ungated/gated partition:

| Scenario                                      | Behaviour                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Termination tool + regular tools in batch     | Termination wins; sibling calls are dropped                                    |
| Multiple termination calls in batch           | First one wins                                                                 |
| Termination action returns `{:ok, result}`    | `status: :completed`, `result: NodeIO.object(result)`, no further directives   |
| Termination action returns `{:error, reason}` | Error fed back to LLM as a tool result; loop continues                         |
| Max iterations exceeded + termination call    | Max iterations error takes precedence (checked first)                          |
| No termination tool configured                | `find_termination_call/2` returns `:not_terminated`; regular dispatch proceeds |

On success, the strategy executes the termination action via `Jido.Exec.run/3`
with the tool call's arguments, wraps the result as `NodeIO.object(result)`,
and sets `status: :completed`.

On error, the strategy builds a tool result with the error and emits a new LLM
call, allowing the LLM to adjust its arguments and retry.

## Init Restoration

The `init/2` callback supports two modes:

| Mode       | Condition                                                      | Behaviour                                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fresh init | No existing strategy state, or status is `:idle`               | Builds full state from DSL options                               |
| Restore    | Strategy state exists with matching module and non-idle status | Preserves checkpoint state; rebuilds runtime-derived fields only |

Runtime-derived fields rebuilt during restore: `nodes`, `tools`, `name_atoms`,
`approval_gate.gated_node_names`, `approval_gate.approval_policy`,
`tool_concurrency.max_concurrency`, `req_options`. All other fields
(conversation, suspended_calls, tool_concurrency, approval_gate.gated_calls,
iteration, context, etc.) are preserved from the checkpoint.

This enables the thaw-start-resume flow: an AgentServer starts with
checkpointed state, `init/2` detects the restored state and avoids overwriting
it, and the subsequent resume signal picks up where the flow left off.

## Checkpoint Integration

The strategy accepts `hibernate_after` in its DSL options and stores it in
strategy state. Whenever a Suspend directive is emitted (from tool suspension,
approval gate, or HITL), `Checkpoint.maybe_add_checkpoint_and_stop/2` inspects
`hibernate_after` and appends a CheckpointAndStop directive if the suspension
timeout exceeds the threshold. See [Persistence](../hitl/persistence.md) for
the full checkpoint lifecycle.
