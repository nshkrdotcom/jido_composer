# Jido Composer Usage Rules

## Intent

Compose agents and actions into higher-order flows via two nestable patterns: deterministic Workflow (FSM) and dynamic Orchestrator (LLM tool-use loop).

## Core Contracts

- All nodes implement `context → context` (endomorphism monoid over maps, composed via Kleisli arrows).
- Node types: **ActionNode** (wraps `Jido.Action`), **AgentNode** (wraps `Jido.Agent`), **FanOutNode** (parallel branches), **HumanNode** (suspend for human input).
- Nodes return `{:ok, context}`, `{:ok, context, outcome_atom}`, or `{:error, reason}`. HumanNode returns `{:ok, context, :suspend}`.
- Context layers: each node's output merges under its key via deep merge. Access upstream results with `get_in(params, [:node_key, :field])`.
- Directives describe side effects: `Suspend`, `SuspendForHuman`, `FanOutBranch`, `CheckpointAndStop`.

## Workflow Patterns

- DSL: `use Jido.Composer.Workflow` with `name`, `nodes` (map of atom → module), `transitions` (map of `{state, outcome} => next_state`).
- Transitions are exhaustive; use `{:_, :error} => :failed` as catch-all.
- Custom outcomes: nodes return `{:ok, ctx, :custom_outcome}` to branch. Transition map must cover all possible outcomes.
- FanOutNode: `fork_fns` returns list of `{branch_key, fun}` pairs. Results merge under each branch key.
- HumanNode: always returns `:suspend` outcome. Pair with `SuspendForHuman` directive for approval gates.
- Terminal states: `:done` and `:failed` are conventional.

## Orchestrator Patterns

- DSL: `use Jido.Composer.Orchestrator` with `name`, `description`, `tools` (list of action/agent modules).
- `query_sync/2` drives a ReAct loop: LLM picks tools → execute → feed results back → repeat until termination.
- `termination_tool`: a `Jido.Action` module whose schema defines structured output. LLM calls it as a regular tool to emit the final answer.
- Tool wrapping: modules listed in `tools` are auto-converted to LLM tool descriptions via `AgentTool`.
- Approval gates: per-tool `requires_approval: true` + `approval_policy` function. Gated tool calls emit `SuspendForHuman`.
- Streaming: `stream: true` uses Finch directly, bypassing Req plugs. Disable streaming when using cassette/stub plugs for testing.
- LLM config: DSL supports `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `stream`, `termination_tool`, `llm_opts`.
- **Runtime configuration**: `configure/2` overrides strategy state after `new/0` but before `query_sync/3`. Accepts `:system_prompt`, `:nodes`, `:model`, `:temperature`, `:max_tokens`, `:req_options`, `:conversation`. The `:nodes` override rebuilds tools/name_atoms/schema_keys internally and handles termination tool dedup.
- **Read accessors**: `get_action_modules/1` returns current node modules; `get_termination_module/1` returns the termination tool module. Use for read-filter-write patterns (RBAC).

## Composition

- Any node can be another Workflow or Orchestrator (arbitrary nesting).
- AgentNode wraps a `Jido.Agent` as a node — the child runs its own strategy internally.
- **Jido.AI agents** (`use Jido.AI.Agent`) are auto-detected via `ask_sync/3` and work as first-class nodes. Composer spawns a temporary AgentServer, queries it, and shuts it down. Requires the Jido supervision tree to be running.
- When used as orchestrator tools, Jido.AI agents expose `{"query": "string"}` schema (not internal state fields).
- Context flows top-down; child results merge into parent context under the node key.
- FanOutNode `fork_fns` receive the current context and return branch-specific params.
- Control spectrum: Workflow (fully deterministic) → Orchestrator (LLM-driven) → Jido.AI agent (ReAct) → mixed nesting.

## HITL & Persistence

- Suspension reasons: `:human_input_required`, `:approval_required`, or custom atoms.
- `ApprovalRequest`: serializable struct with unique `id`, `tool_call`, `context_snapshot`. `ApprovalResponse`: `approved | rejected | modified` with optional `modifications`.
- Checkpoint: `Checkpoint.save/2` serializes state. `ChildRef` replaces live PIDs for safe serialization.
- Resume: `Resume.resume/2` thaws from checkpoint. Top-down: parent resumes, then re-attaches children.
- Parent isolation: parent doesn't know child is paused. Rejection is internalized within child.

## Testing

- **ReqCassette** for e2e tests with recorded API responses. Never hand-craft cassettes; delete and re-record with `RECORD_CASSETTES=true mix test`.
- **LLMStub direct mode** (`LLMStub.setup/1` + `LLMStub.execute/1`): process-dictionary queue for strategy tests.
- **LLMStub plug mode** (`LLMStub.setup_req_stub/2`): Req.Test.stub-backed queue for DSL `query_sync` tests.
- LLMAction retries once by default — error stubs need 2+ responses to cover the retry.
- Disable streaming (`stream: false`) when cassette/stub plug is active (Finch bypasses Req plugs).
- Propagate `req_options` for plug injection: LLMAction passes them as `req_http_options` to ReqLLM.

## Avoid

- Calling LLM APIs directly; use `Orchestrator` + `LLMAction` which handles tool conversion and retries.
- Embedding runtime side effects in node logic; emit directives instead.
- Using `String.to_atom/1` on untrusted input (node keys, outcomes).
- Assuming streaming works with test plugs; always set `stream: false` in stub/cassette tests.
- Skipping `mix precommit` before commits.
